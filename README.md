#README golang auto install

`Script By: Gentry Rolofson`

Fully automatic golang install script for mac OSX.

To run this script properly all you need to do is cd into the location of the installgo.sh file and type into terminal

`. installgo.sh`

From there you can follow the onscreen instructions, this will give the option to install homebrew for mac OSX << a very good package manager think apt-get

It will then install wget this is also an essential terminal tool.

This tool will also place your goworkspace in the proper location with your git username, and automatically setup your go environment variables, setting them inside your `.bash_profile`
